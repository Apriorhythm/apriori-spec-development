# Delta — archive-merge (delta-consumption)

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: the delta parser consumes its whole input
`parseDeltaStrict` SHALL be a sequential, fully-consuming parser: every line (outside code fences, which are opaque) belongs to exactly one legal construct — file preamble (stamp/blank/free text without structure markers), a legal `## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED|RENAMED Requirements` heading, section-preamble free text, a `### Requirement:` block (body runs to the next heading or EOF), or a RENAMED `- Old -> New` line — and anything else is a `problems[]` entry carrying its 1-based line number. The exhaustive problem set: unrecognized h2 headings (one problem per heading; its lines are never absorbed into any bucket), requirement/scenario markers before any section, a requirement block inside RENAMED, a scenario marker outside any requirement, duplicate requirement names, and the stamp problems (which also gain line numbers). Both `verify --change` (exit 2) and `archive` (exit 1) inherit the failure.

#### Scenario: AM-28 a misspelled section heading is reported, never absorbed
- WHEN a delta contains `## ADDDED Requirements` (or any other unrecognized h2) followed by requirement blocks
- THEN parsing reports the heading text with its line number, those requirements appear in NO bucket, and archive/verify fail closed

#### Scenario: AM-29 structure outside its legal home is reported with line numbers
- WHEN a `### Requirement:` appears before any section or inside a RENAMED section, or a `#### Scenario:` appears in a section preamble outside any requirement
- THEN each is a problem carrying its 1-based line number; multiple distinct problems are all reported

#### Scenario: AM-30 free text and fences stay legal; the corpus stays clean
- WHEN a delta carries titles/notes in the file preamble, section preambles, or requirement bodies, or fenced content containing heading-like lines
- THEN no problem is reported — and every archived delta in this repo's `apriori/changes/archive/*/specs/` parses with zero problems (the regression corpus)

#### Scenario: AM-31 stamp problems carry line numbers
- WHEN a delta carries a malformed, duplicated, or misplaced apriori-base stamp
- THEN each stamp problem names its 1-based line number
